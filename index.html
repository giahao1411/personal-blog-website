                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Greetings everyone, and thank you for visiting my website. My name is Gia Hao Tran, and I am
                    delighted
                    to welcome you to this blog, which I have personally created. This platform serves as a digital
                    journal, chronicling my personal journey and growth. Whether it's sharing my daily reflections or
                    documenting my evolving passion, this space encapsulates my experiences and aspirations. It all
                    began on September 24th, 2021, when I embarked on my coding journey. Delving into the world of
                    programming, my initial encounter was with Pascal, igniting a spark of curiosity and enthusiasm
                    within me.</p>

                <p>As I navigate through the realms of coding and technology, I am fueled by an unwavering determination
                    to pursue my passion relentlessly. This website stands as a testament to my dedication and
                    commitment to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base. Each line of code, each project
                    undertaken, represents a stepping stone towards my aspirations. With every keystroke, I am propelled
                    forward, inching closer to my ultimate goal.</p>

                <p>I am immensely grateful for the support and encouragement extended to me on this journey. Your
                    unwavering belief in my abilities serves as a constant source of motivation, spurring me on during
                    challenging times. As I pour my heart and soul into this endeavor, I am buoyed by the conviction
                    that my passion will sustain me in the long run. With your continued support, I am confident that I
                    will overcome obstacles and emerge triumphant.</p>

                <p id="more-info" class="more-info">In closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of
                    you who has taken the time to read and explore my website. Your presence here validates my efforts
                    and reinforces my determination to pursue my dreams fervently. As I continue to tread this path of
                    self-discovery and growth, I invite you to join me on this exhilarating journey. Together, let us
                    embrace the boundless possibilities that lie ahead and carve out our own paths to success. Thank you
                    for being a part of my story, and may your days be filled with joy and fulfillment.</p>
